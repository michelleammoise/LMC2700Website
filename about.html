      <p>Hi! I am originally from South Florida and was raised in metro-Atlanta. I am Afro-Caribbean (Haitian and
        Honduran). Before coming to Tech, I dreamed of pursuing a passion in pharmacy and taking over the family
        business. However, my heart always been with my love for technology. Coming to Tech my freshman year was
        overwhelming. My peers had years of experience behind them meanwhile, I arrived without knowing what a coding
        language was outside of HTML
        (which I thought was the most popular to know and is still regularly taught). I had to learn to not let my lack
        of experience in comparison to others' experiences define me and to strive for success. In the future, I am
        hoping to pursue a career within the design realm of computer science. More specifically, I am leaning towards
        <b>UI</b>Design, Front-end Software Engineering or Web Development.<br>
        For fun, I enjoy watching anime, attending music festivals/concerts, and playing video games. Whenever I have
        free time, I like to create and edit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@michvibesss" target="_blank"
          style="color:white">YouTube
          videos</a>. It has been a hobby of mine for since middle school, which
        I am hoping to eventually stay consistent with creating content.
